BLOGSCRAPER

Parse the generated HTML from a WordPress blog and write
the resulting files to whatever format seems best.

Created to save the contents of a blog which disappeared
from the internet, and only the static contents existed.

It should be possible to reinsert the resulting RSS files
into another WordPress instance.
